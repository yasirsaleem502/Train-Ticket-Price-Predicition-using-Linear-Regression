## Introduction

Train ticket prices can vary significantly based on multiple factors. This project focuses on using a Linear Regression model to predict the price of train tickets by analyzing key features that affect pricing. This model can be valuable for travelers, allowing them to anticipate costs and make informed decisions.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes several features that influence train ticket prices:

- **`Travel Distance`**: The total distance between the starting point and destination.
- **`Travel Class`**: The class in which the passenger is traveling (e.g., economy, business).
- **`Booking Time`**: The time difference between the booking date and the travel date.
- **`Day of the Week`**: The day of the week on which the journey is made.
- **`Holiday Indicator`**: Whether the journey falls on or near a public holiday.
- **`Train Type`**: The type of train (e.g., express, local).

These features are utilized to predict the target variable, which is the `Ticket Price`.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing steps included:
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables (e.g., travel class, train type)
- Scaling numerical features (e.g., travel distance)

## Exploratory Data Analysis

In this section, the relationships between different features and ticket prices were analyzed. Visualizations and statistical methods were used to identify trends, correlations, and outliers in the data.

## Model Building

A Linear Regression model was built using Scikit-learn. The model was trained on the preprocessed dataset, using the features mentioned above to predict the train ticket prices.

## Model Evaluation

The model's performance was assessed using various metrics:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **R-squared (RÂ²)**

These metrics helped evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of the model.

## Conclusion

The Linear Regression model provided a good prediction of train ticket prices based on the selected features. This model can be further improved by incorporating additional data or using more complex algorithms.
